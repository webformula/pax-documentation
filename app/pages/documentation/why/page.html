  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>
    One might ask <b>why another framework?</b> My first response to that question is "this is not a framework". PAX is a tool set that can replace the need for a framework.
    Browsers have come a very long way since the days of IE. The modern browser is powerful and concise. You can achieve 95% of the things you need with just the browser these days.
    With the recent addition of web-components we can built powerful elegant applications with almost no 3rd party modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>PAX</b> provides the missing 5% of what the browser does not. Page classes, dynamic rendering, and single page application routing.

  <h6 style="padding-top: 36px"><b>Let's focus on the development process</b></h6>
  <p>Todays applications can be a burden on developers. You install a bucket of dependencies, setup multiple tools on your computer and wait seconds every time you make a code change to see it realized on the screen.</p>
  <p>
    PAX relies on todays best practices and standards like ES modules. This means there is no need for build tools while developing. All the major browsers support ES modules directly. This means the code you write is the code that runs. No source maps, no waiting for webpack to build and no transpiling.
    This makes debugging and understanding your code simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to get back the what was great about the web, write code, run code, release code. What you see is what you get!
